# Fast Food Service

## What is this?

This is a small project of mine to practice some Solid.js, Flutter and Axum.

## What is it about?

As the name implies it is a Service for Fast Food restaurants.
It is used for managing orders from a mobile app so that small restaurants that cannot afford proper cash registers can use a tablet or phone in order to manage orders.
The web frontend is used for the owner and managers only so that they have a dashboard of all the orders of the day, how much money there should be in the restaurant and to modify the possible orders.
There is also the possiblity for future improvment to create a app for self-ordering.

## To-Do

- [ ] a lot, still in planning
